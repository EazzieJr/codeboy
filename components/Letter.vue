                        Meetings and Makeups is a mixtape about balancing work with toxic fun relationships. I wanted to
                        take different sounds
                        and feelings and put it all into one project. When I finished recording this mixtape, I asked
                        myself
                        how I could market
                        it. I was inspired by the Nipsey Hussle $1,000 mixtape and wanted to create that same type of
                        impact. I always took note
                        of artists speaking out against their record deals which made me want to be independent from
                        Major
                        Labels but I started
                        to think about the idea of dependence. I don’t want to be indedent, I want to be dependent on my
                        fans. Artists can now
                        depend on their community to manage and propel their careers. This is my experiment with CODE
                        LIFE
                        Records.

                        Im signing myself to a life-360 deal to CODE LIFE Records. I’m putting my musi career in the
                        hands
                        of people I have
                        never met. Now my true fans can make money when I make money. The only way a major label will
                        make
                        revenue from me
                        is if
                        they own a CB SAI Look. I will split all of my earnings 80/20 with CODE LIFE Records. From
                        inperson/metaverse
                        performances to streaming rev, NFT royalties and more.
