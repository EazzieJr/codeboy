                        I swear to god I wont change up

                        Our bond was so real

                        Me and you was gonna build (yea x2)

                        Dates on your day off

                        Ate you like a meal

                        You put me in my feelings


                        (Verse 1)

                        Killing them with no makeup

                        And I know they hate us

                        Cause’ we always shining, always grinding, money makers

                        In the hills like lakers

                        I ain’t got a contract

                        And I need a million plus cause under? I aint signing that

                        Working hard, Shining hard

                        Remember being in the dark

                        Remember when I pushed the cars

                        Now the cars is push to start

                        And I really need that contract 

                        Cause I really like to ball

                        Keep my lawyer on retainer

                        Cause I cant aint even trust these broads

                        I like all types designer

                        Im in Cali like a Niner

                        Glow em up I got the Midas (Touch)

                        Man we got too high with the Pilot (Fuck)


                        (Bridge)

                        People grow, feelings change, I hope our time ain’t up 

                        Don’t compare to anybody, other people aint us

                        I know the money wont change me

                        Hope the money don’t change ya

                        I just wanna stay down, stay low

                        Make my money, make love

                        We makeup to breakup

                        You’d promise that you wait up

                        Ima see you later, get back and get this paper


                        (Hook)

                        Cause I never change, never change

                        Girl I never switch up

                        If I cut you off you missing me

                        I’ll never miss ya

                        (Chorus)

                        I swear to god I wont change up

                        Our bond was so real

                        Me and you was gonna build (yea x2)

                        Dates on your day off
